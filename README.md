# IDS706_Complex_SQL_Query_for_A_MySQL_Database

This repository is for the IDS706 course's assignment: IDS706_Complex_SQL_Query_for_A_MySQL_Database

![CI](https://github.com/therealzella/IDS706-python-github-template/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

## Complex SQL Query Explanation

This query retrieves the total amount spent by each customer by joining the `customers`, `orders`, and `order_items` tables. The results are grouped by customer name and sorted in descending order of the total amount spent.

## Project Overview
This repository is a Python project template designed for the IDS706 course. It includes:
- A `main.py` file with the core functionality.
- A `main_test.py` file with unit tests for the project.
- A `Makefile` for automating common tasks like formatting, linting, and testing.
- A `.gitignore` file to keep unnecessary files out of your repository.
- A `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies.
- A `test.db` file autogenerated by the main.py file

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/therealzella/IDS706_Python_Script_interacting_with_SQL_Database.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd IDS706_Python_Script_interacting_with_SQL_Database
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    make install
    ```

## Usage
You can run the main script using:
```sh
python main.py
```

## Testing
To run tests to validate changes, use the following command:
```sh
make test
```

## CI/CD Documentation
This project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring that all code pushed to the main branch is automatically tested across multiple Python versions. The CI/CD process includes:

  - ### Continuous Integration and Deployment
  - **CI/CD Process**: This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Our CI pipeline automatically runs on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.
  - **Setup**: The workflow sets up the Python environment based on the matrix configuration.
  - **Dependency Installation**: Dependencies are installed using the requirements file.
  - **Linting**: Code is linted with flake8 to ensure it meets our coding standards.
  - **Testing**: Tests are executed using pytest to validate functionality.

    - Automated Testing: On every push or pull request to the main branch, the CI pipeline runs linting, testing,         and other checks defined in the ci.yml file.
        - Steps Included in the Workflow:
        - Setup of the specified Python environment using actions/setup-python@v3.
        - Installation of dependencies via make install.
        - Linting with flake8 to maintain code quality.
        - Running unit tests with pytest.
